LexMate – Your AI-Powered Legal Document Assistant
🧠 The Problem
Every day, small businesses and legal firms spend countless hours manually reviewing contracts, agreements, and compliance documents. This not only wastes valuable time and manpower but also increases the risk of missing critical clauses or legal red flags hidden deep within pages of dense text.
